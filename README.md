# Serial-Statistic-Analyzer-with-Error-Detection

In this VHDL project, our objective is to design a system that receives blocks of data via serial communication and performs statistical analysis, 
including calculations for maximum, minimum, average, and median values. 
Additionally, the system will detect and quantify errors in the communication for each received block of data. 
We'll incorporate pre-existing component files to support the implementation.
